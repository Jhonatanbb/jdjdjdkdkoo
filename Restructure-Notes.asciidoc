= Purpose

This is some notes about the long overdue restructuring of Sherlock.

= Goals

1. Make Sherlock work as a general package.
2. Allow extensibility for other types of detection mechanisms. +
   Many websites now require Javascript to be enabled before one can query about support for a given username.  We need a line of site to achieve this.
3. Allow Core Functionality To Be Other Than As A Command Line Tool +
   While Sherlock has started out as a command line tool, it would also be useful to allow it to be used as an API or as a module for a web site.

= Detail

== Print Statements
Sherlock has bunches of areas where print statements are embedded directly into the functional aspects of the code.  This needs to be removed.
Some of these print statements are for troubleshooting (these should be integrated into the logging module).  Others are for printing the results (these need to be deferred to a higher level module whose sole responsibility is printing the results).
