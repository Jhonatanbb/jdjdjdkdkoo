# Welcome To The Sherlock Wiki!

## Purpose
Sherlock is a tool that scans social networks (and other sites) for the existence of a specified username.

The [current list](https://github.com/theyahya/sherlock/blob/master/sites.md) shows the sites that are scanned.

**NOTE**: Sherlock is not accepting adult sites in the standard list. Adult sites may be added to the [sherlock-data-nsfw](https://github.com/sherlock-project/sherlock-data-nsfw) repo
